# Create Astral Backtank

This mod is more or less a fork of [Create Air Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-air-fabric), with some minor changes and updates. Notably, backtanks can no longer be refilled in enivorenments without oxygen, and copper diving gear is now cold resistant (at least in the context of space).
